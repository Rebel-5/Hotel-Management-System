# Hotel-Management-System
I aspire to create a Hotel Management System, wherein  users can input guest information, encompassing comprehensive details such as check-in and check-out times, alongside the allocation of hotel rooms.
# Functional Requirements:
1) Implement a feature to meticulously record reservations.
2) Collect and store complete customer information, including their name, CNIC, phone number, and both check-in and check-out times.
3) Enable t he tracking of the number of occupants per room.
4) Develop the capability for the system to efficiently check-in customers upon their arrival.
5) Create a system that can seamlessly archive customer feedback.
6) Ensure secure access to the system through unique usernames.
7) Assign a distinctive identification number to each customer.
8) - Enable the system to generate comprehensive reports on a monthly, yearly, and daily basis. These reports should detail customer visitation patterns and identify months or days when the hotel is not profitable.
9)  - Incorporate a search feature allowing the retrieval of guest records using their CNIC numbers.
10)  - Implement a feature that displays whether a guest has previously visited the hotel.
11) - Enforce additional charges if a guest checks out after the designated time
12)  Establish an administrative page for user management, hotel report review, and the ability to change usernames and passwords.
13) Allow new hotels to request admin approval for login credentials to participate in the system.
14) The system should promptly notify the administrator in the event that a criminal gains access to the hotel premises..
15) All users must have the capability to update their account passwords at regular intervals, such as every 15 days or as specified. Failure to do so will result in account lockout, which can only be rectified through the admin site.
16)  The system should facilitate the entry of room details, including their respective prices.
17)  Upon a guest's arrival, the system should promptly showcase all available rooms along with their corresponding prices for the guest's selection.
18) The system shall track all meals purchased in the hotel (restaurant and room service)
19) Display room revenue for a specified period of time (days).
20) Display an exception report, showing where default room and food prices have been overridden
